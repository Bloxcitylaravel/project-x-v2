This is done with the help of nginx. Cloudflare sends your request to our VPS, which is then processed by nginx. Nginx then passes your request to the game server. Our game server program receives a local IP address from nginx, and not your IP address directly. This means that if someone discovers (and abuses) a severe vulnerability in our game server software, they would not be able to collect IP addresses of users.

Your IP is only ever saved for a maximum of 24 hours, after which it is deleted automatically from where it is stored (usually Redis - IPs are deleted once they expire, which can be between 5 minutes and 24 hours depending on the task you perform).
